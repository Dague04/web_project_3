# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

**Intro**

This is a responsive webpage about traveling across the US. Optimized images were used to help the page load faster because large image files can slow down a website, thus creating a less than optimal user experience. Flexbox and CSS Grid were used for the page's layout. It is designed responsively for screen display widths of 360px to 1280px resolution. CSS classes are organized according the BEM guidelines.
Media queries are used to modify the page depending on a device's specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser viewport width).

The site was designed according to the specification of the following Figma design:
